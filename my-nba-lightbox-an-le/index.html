            <h2 class="lb-heading"> Luka Dončić - Luka Magic of the LA Lakers </h2>
            <p class="lb-text">Luka Dončić's career began with an unprecedented dominance in Europe, winning the EuroLeague MVP and Championship with Real Madrid at just 19 (2018) before being drafted 3rd overall by the Dallas Mavericks. He quickly became an NBA superstar, earning the 2019 Rookie of the Year and an astonishing five consecutive selections to the All-NBA First Team and All-Star Game (2020-2024). In the 2023-2024 season, he led the NBA in scoring, was named the Western Conference Finals MVP, and guided the Mavericks to the NBA Finals. In a major mid-career shift, Dončić was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers in 2025, where he has immediately started breaking franchise records and continues to perform as one of the elite players in the league.</p>

            <h2 class="lb-heading">Anthony Edwards - The Ant-Man of the Timber Wolves</h2>
            <p class="lb-text">Anthony Edwards journey began in Atlanta, where he channeled personal tragedy into a fearless passion for basketball, quickly rising to become the nation's top recruit. After one dynamic season at the University of Georgia, he was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2020 NBA Draft by the Minnesota Timberwolves. "Ant-Man" immediately made his mark, earning All-Rookie honors and thrilling fans with his explosive athleticism and confident shooting. He rapidly matured into a superstar, becoming a multi-time NBA All-Star and All-NBA selection. Edwards led the Timberwolves to their deepest playoff run in two decades during the 2023–24 season, culminating in a trip to the Western Conference Finals, shortly followed by winning a gold medal with the 2024 U.S. Olympic team. At only 24, Edwards is now cemented as the charismatic, clutch leader of the Timberwolves and a leading candidate to become the face of the entire NBA.
