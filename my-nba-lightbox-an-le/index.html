            <h2 class="lb-heading">De'Aaron Fox - Swipa the Fox leader of The Kings</h2>
            <p class="lb-text">De'Aaron Fox, known as "Swipa" for his quick hands and relentless steals, first burst onto the national scene as a hyper-speed point guard at the University of Kentucky. His defining moment there was outdueling future No. 1 pick Lonzo Ball in the Sweet Sixteen, cementing his reputation for elite athleticism and clutch play.

Drafted No. 5 overall in the 2017 NBA Draft by the Sacramento Kings, Fox immediately became the face of the franchise. He embraced the task of breaking the Kings' decades-long playoff drought, leading a fast-paced, exciting brand of basketball. While the team struggled early, Fox consistently improved, developing his three-point shot and honing his playmaking skills.

The pivotal moment of his career came in the 2022–23 season. Fox led the Kings to their first playoff appearance in 16 years, earning his first NBA All-Star selection and winning the inaugural Clutch Player of the Year award. His ability to hit game-winners and take over in the fourth quarter earned him a new moniker: "Swerve." Alongside Domantas Sabonis, Fox has since cemented the Kings as a competitive force in the Western Conference, making him one of the most exciting and dynamic guards in the league today. </p>
